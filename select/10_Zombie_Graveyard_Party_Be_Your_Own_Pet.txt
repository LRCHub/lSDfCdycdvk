I'm dead baby
As dead as can be
Its all because a zombie ate me
You loved me when I was alive
And now you see that I'm on the other side
I still wanna go out with you
But there's something that you gotta do
Give your life up and over to me
C'mon you'll see how happy we could be
I've gotta tell you this before you die
Love is pretty lame so let me eat your brain
If you really love me like you say you do
You'll go through the pain and now let me eat your brain
life is lame so let me eat your brain
Life is lame so let me eat your brain
Life is lame so let me eat your brain
Life is lame so let me eat your...
we could party, party in the graveyard tonight
Don't you wanna party, party in the graveyard tonight?
We could party, party in the graveyard tonight
Don't you wanna party, party in the graveyard tonight?
life is lame so let me eat your brain
Life is lame so let me eat your brain
Life is lame so let me eat your brain
Life is lame so let me eat your...
we could party, party in the graveyard tonight
Don't you wanna party, party in the graveyard tonight?
We could party, party in the graveyard tonight
Don't you wanna party, party in the graveyard tonight?
